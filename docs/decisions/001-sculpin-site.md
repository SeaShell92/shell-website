# Why Sculpin

## Context

Why did I make a Sculpin static website over building a Drupal site?

## Decision

Sculpin uses twig templates which I am familiar with.  Drupal would require hosting a database which I would not utilise in full for this kind of project.

## Consequences
Static websites have their limitations.  Although each page is a template, the content needs to be built by hand.  No fancy modules to install but that does mean much less code.
