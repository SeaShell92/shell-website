Hi! I'm Shelley Lay, a female Software Developer Graduate working at Transport for Wales.

I built this website as a portfolio of my work as part of the 2023 Graduate cohort at Transport for Wales.  The graduate scheme covers a period of two years and I wrote this website at the end of my first year so come back for updates!

Please take a look around using the links above.
