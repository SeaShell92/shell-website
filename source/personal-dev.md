title: Personal Development

Although I've learned a lot of useful skills on the job, I have also been developing as a person with the help of my colleagues and time spent outside of work.

Working as part of a small team of four has given me the opportunity to speak and be heard and for my ideas to accepted and intergrated into the work dynamic.  At first I was shy because I was new and I didn't want to be too pushy or put a foot wrong, but over the last 6 months at least, I've really gained some confidence in just saying what's on my mind and giving my opinion even if it is different to the group.

Being a female software developer is actually rare in the industry, so I already bring a fresh point of view by being different to my 3 male colleagues.  During university I volunteered to teach STEM workshops in schools, including teaching young girls that it is not just a "boy thing" to like Science, Technology, Engineering or Maths.
