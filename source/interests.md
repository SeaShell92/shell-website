# Hobbies and Interests

There's more to me than software development!  Here are a few of my main hobbies and interests.

## Pin badge collecting

I don't know when it started but I seem to have collected quite a lot of pin badges of different shapes, sizes and styles.  They're such a big part of me, I often wear them on my bag.  Sometimes I put some on my jackets and lanyards as well!

## Alternative Fashion

As a rebellious teenager in the early 2000s I decided I wanted to wear skulls on my clothes and I've been a fan of alternative fashion ever since.

## Watching Anime

My first ever anime I enjoyed watching was Yu-Gi-Oh! Which was shown as a cartoon during my childhood.  In 2020, I discovered the anime channel on Amazon Prime Video and from then on I haven't stopped watching all kinds of anime. I currently pay a subscription to Crunchyroll to keep up with my favourite shows.

If you're brave enough, you can view a list I made of every anime I have watched on the MyAnimeList website [here](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/solar0wolf).
