There's more to me than software development!  Here are a few of my main hobbies and interests.

## Pin badge collecting

I don't know when it started but I seem to have collected quite a lot of pin badges of different shapes, sizes and styles.  If you've ever spotted me in the wild, or at the office, you may have noticed a collection on my bag.  Sometimes I put some on my jackets and lanyards as well!  I mainly collect alternative/goth/spooky pins, anime related pins and LGBT+ Pride pins.

## Alternative Fashion

As a rebellious teenager in the early 2000s I decided I wanted to wear skulls on my clothes and I've been a fan of alternative fashion ever since.  As the name suggests, "alternative" is anything alternative to the normal, "high street" fashion trends.  It's the people you see who always seem to stand out from the crowd, or form their own crowds.  Goth is the main one I like to wear but anything grunge, punk, metal or spooky also forms part my large wardrobe of clothes.  My friend gifted me a pin that says "Spooky for life, not just for halloween" and that sums me up quite nicely!

## Watching Anime

My first ever anime I enjoyed watching was Yu-Gi-Oh! Which was shown as a cartoon during my childhood.  In 2020, I discovered the anime channel on Amazon Prime Video and from then on I haven't stopped watching all kinds of anime. I currently pay a subscription to Crunchyroll to keep up with my favourite shows.  I'm really bad at keeping up though, I just watch whenever I feel like escaping from the mundane! "Super hero" or "Supernatural" type shows are my usual favourites but...

If you're brave enough, you can view a list I made of pretty much every single anime I have ever watched on the MyAnimeList website [here](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Solar0Wolf?status=7&order=4&order2=0).  It's listed by rank, so you'll see my 10/10 rated shows first.
