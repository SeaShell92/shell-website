title: Graduate Training & Achievements
---

Thanks to the TfW Graduate programme I have completed two training courses through the training provider QA Ltd in my first year:

* March 2024: APM Project Fundamentals Qualification (PFQ)
* July 2024: Organising Work and Time

Since my University degree was very practical in terms of coding, I decided to use the graduate scheme training opportunities to learn other skills that would be useful to maintain a healthy work/life balance.

## Notable Achievements

Through TfW's Learning & Development team, I have completed my Insights Discovery profile and discovered I have a strong blue & green preference to how I handle my work.  This makes me a co-ordinating observer. I like to take my time, gather facts, learn through observation and visual mediums but I also like to help guide people to accomplish their goals as well.

I created a presentation to reflect on my first 6 months in the graduate scheme at TfW.  Not only did I present this to my fellow graduates, I also presented this at the Knowledge Cafe, a meeting for the wider Knowledge team to get together and share information, as we don't always cross paths in our day-to-day work.
