# University Projects

Please visit my github repositories to view the code I created during my time studying BSc Computing at the University of South Wales.  This practical work gave me the knowledge I use to write code and solve problems in my job today.

## Year 3 (final year) Project

My final year dissertation had a focus on Geographic Information Systems.  I created a website to demonstrate my knowledge and my ability visually represent large amounts of data using Leaflet and JavaScript.  

The website I made for this project is available to view [here](https://ces-web2.southwales.ac.uk/students/30021038/IS3D660/home.html) but please note, it is hosted by the University and may not always be available.

[Traffic Accident Mapping Code](https://github.com/SeaShell92/IndividualProject2023). Note: without the database, hosted by the university, the code alone may not function as intended.

## Year 2 Project

Team project with a focus on teamwork and collaboration, therefore the final product is not finished.  All teams were given the same brief about updating a hotel booking system using .Net framework and C# programming language again.

## Year 1 Project

As an introduction to coding, we all made a small game in Visual Studio that runs in .Net framework.  We were all given the same base game and asked to add to it.  This is mine:
