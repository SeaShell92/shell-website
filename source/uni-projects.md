Please visit my github repositories using the links below to view the code I created during my time studying BSc Computing at the University of South Wales.  This practical work gave me the knowledge I use to write code and solve problems in my job today.  All links open in a new tab so you can keep reading even if you click the links.

## Year 3 (final year) Project

My final year dissertation had a focus on Geographic Information Systems.  I created a website to demonstrate my knowledge and my ability visually represent large amounts of data on a map using Leaflet and JavaScript.  

The website I made for this project is available to view <a href="https://shelley-web-map.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a> (opens in new tab).  The first 3 toggles show the information using locally stored data in geoJSON files.  The 4th toggle, titled "Accidents per km" is no longer functional because I accessed and displayed the data using a Web Map Service (WMS) request to the university's GeoServer, which I no longer have a valid connection to.

## Year 2 Project

Team project with a focus on teamwork and collaboration, therefore the final product is not finished.  All teams were given the same brief about updating a hotel booking system using .Net framework and C# programming language again.

## Year 1 Project

As an introduction to coding, we all made a small game in Visual Studio that runs in .Net framework.  We were all given the same base game and asked to add to it.  I changed my game from something like minesweeper to something like snake, where you create a trail and have to avoid that as well as the mines.  For my first ever coding project, it was actually kind of fun to make.  I mainly focus on making websites now instead of applications.
