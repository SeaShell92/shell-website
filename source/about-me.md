[comment]: # (re-write this page later)

Office jobs were my life right up until I decided a change of career was required in the middle of 2019.  I did one year Access to Higher Education course in college before 3 years of university which lead me to the graduate job I have today.  Yes, I did my first year of university in lockdown of 2020.  My only work experience comes from the "pre-covid era" as I call it and that was a very different world to the one we live in now.  Thankfully my current job has given me plenty of time to adjust and the company have been very supportive.

I have been a working professional since I was 20.  I obtained my first NVQ way back in 2010 and I used that course to gain work experience as an administrative assistant ever since.  I've also gained a few more NVQs along the way and one Level 2 VRQ in Beauty Specialist Techniques, just because I wanted to brush up on my people skills.  It's a vocational qualification but I decided not to pursue that career option after all.

## Work History

I have a LinkedIn page you can visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shelley-lay-932577b4/" target="_blank">here</a>, so I won't bore you with the details on this page. The photo I use on LinkedIn is a bit out of date but I wanted to capture my joy of graduating from University in 2023.

My father also had an administrative job so I think my love of paperwork comes from him but my affinity with computers was also clear from a young age, it just took a while for me to acknowledge it myself.

## Life outside of work

If you want to know more about my hobbies, there's a page for that [here](/interests). If you'd like to know about my personal development, there's a page for that [here](/personal-dev).  My party days are behind me, if I do go out on weekends it's mainly to go shopping and then come home and chill out.  I also like to attend anime conventions and craft market events when I can.
