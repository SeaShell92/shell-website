## Software Development Team

This Graduate position is quite unique from the other graduates in that I don't have any rotations so I've stayed in one team the whole time I've been working!

We are a small team of four who take care of the main Transport for Wales webiste, <a href="https://tfw.wales/" target="_blank">tfw.wales</a> (opens in new tab), including the Welsh language site <a href="https://trc.cymru/" target="_blank">trc.cymru</a> (opens in new tab).

Although I don't have official rotations, I have worked closely with the Content Team and the User Experience Designer to help update the bits of the website you can see, as well as helping my own team ensure things keep running smoothly behind the curtain.
